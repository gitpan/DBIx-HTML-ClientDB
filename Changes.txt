Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::HTML::ClientDB.

1.05  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.04  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.03  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.
